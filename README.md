# Server IP Finder for Games

A Python-based tool to monitor and identify active game servers by analyzing CPU usage, network traffic, and UDP connections in real-time.
Perfect to identify active live game IP & Ports! 

- `Has to be in a live game session to have anything to grab!`
- `Install requirements`
- `Open python via cmd or just the exe for it to be no commands to run`

## Features
- **Monitor CPU Usage**: Identify top CPU-consuming processes.
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: List network interfaces and their traffic stats.
- **UDP Monitoring**: Track and analyze UDP traffic to detect active game servers.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Step-by-step process selection and intuitive output.
- **Threshold-Based Alerts**: Alerts on significant data transfer rates to help pinpoint the active server.


## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Libraries:
  - `psutil`
  - `pyshark`
  - `colorama` (optional, for color-coded output)
- TShark installed and accessible in the system path.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zebbern/GameSniffer.git
   cd GameSniffer
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   or
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure TShark is installed on your system. Follow the [Wireshark documentation](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) for installation instructions.

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   or
   python3 server.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to:
   - Select a process to monitor.
   - Choose a network interface.
   - Identify the active game server based on UDP traffic.

## Example Output
```
[INFO] Starting Game Server Monitoring Tool...

=== Top 10 CPU Consuming Processes ===
No.   Process Name                     CPU Usage (%)
---------------------------------------------------

=== Active Game Server Identified ===
IP Address    : 192.168.1.50
Port          : 27015
Data Rate     : 1200.00 B/s
=====================================
```

## Customization
Modify the following configurations in the script as needed:
- `PROCESS_NAME`: Default process name to monitor (`"cod.exe"`).
- `MONITOR_INTERVAL`: Monitoring interval in seconds (default: `1` second).
- `DATA_RATE_THRESHOLD`: Minimum data rate (in bytes/second) to consider as significant traffic (default: `400`).
